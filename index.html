            <p>I can't believe I finally made my first web up and running-thanks to Github! I must say that I have had to struggle alot to get to this. Interestingly enough, one simple corrected mistake on acode gets me up and running! Well done Brendah! </p>
            <p>Now let us jump into the next phase, you need to learn how to work with css in order for your page to have some style. How do I do this? Let me get to my CSS file to see how this works!</p>
            <p>I am also wondering why this text is aligned with this image below in such a manner, I want both these to be opposite each other as in one on the left and one on the right, hmmmm...where did I go wrong? Could this an error with my CSS?</p>

          I can't believe I finally made my first web up and running-thanks to
          Phiona & Github! I must say that I have had to struggle alot to get to
          this. Interestingly enough, one simple corrected mistake on a code
          gets me up and running, Well done Brendah!

          Now let us jump into the next phase, you need to learn how to work
          with css in order for your page to have some style. How do I do this?
          Let me get to my CSS file to see how this works!
        </p>

          I am also wondering why this text is aligned with this image below in
          such a manner, I want both these to be opposite each other as in one
          on the left and one on the right, hmmmm...where did I go wrong? Could
          this an error with my CSS?
